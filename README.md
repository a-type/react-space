# ðŸŒŒ @a-type/react-space

An attempt to extract a generic 2d spatial canvas primitive in React.

I keep re-inventing 2D canvas primitives. I feel like I've gotten pretty decent at it, but it's a hard problem to abstract well.

This is my first attempt at a general-purpose 2D "infinite" canvas abstraction. "Infinite" in quotes because it's not logically infinite, it's in fact capped, the cap can just be very very high without performance impact (afaik).

`pnpm add @a-type/react-space`

Usage is generally as follows, see `./src/stories` for working examples.

```tsx
import {
	CanvasProvider,
	ViewportRoot,
	CanvasRenderer,
	CanvasObjectRoot,
	CanvasObjectDragHandle,
	useCreateCanvas,
	useCanvasObject,
} from '@a-type/react-space';

function ACanvas() {
	const canvas = useCreateCanvas();

	return (
		<CanvasProvider value={canvas}>
			<ViewportRoot>
				<CanvasRenderer>
					<ANode id="a" />
				</CanvasRenderer>
			</ViewportRoot>
		</CanvasProvider>
	);
}

function ANode({ id }: { id: string }) {
	const canvasObject = useCanvasObject({
		initialPosition: { x: 0, y: 0 },
		objectId: id,
	});

	// sync position to some external source
	useEffect(
		() => someExternalPosition.subscribe(canvasObject.moveTo),
		[canvasObject],
	);

	return (
		<CanvasObjectRoot canvasObject={canvasObject}>
			<CanvasObjectDragHandle>Drag me</CanvasObjectDragHandle>
		</CanvasObjectRoot>
	);
}
```

`useCanvas` also gives you access to the Canvas instance, which has many powerful viewport manipulation and object boundary observation tools.

Unlike other 2D canvas that I know of, this library automatically tracks the size of object elements within the canvas, so it's much easier to do things like intersection queries. Included out of the box is a `<BoxSelect />` component, too. The main `Canvas` has a `selections` property which tracks selected objects by ID. So, the library is kind of opinionated about some common concepts. This may prove to be unfortunate for general usage, but tbh this is mostly for me, anyway.
